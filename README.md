# Final Exam Grade Calculator
This website is a tool for college students to calculate the final grade necessary to obtain a certain grade in a class. This project was written in HTML and CSS, but if this project was done now it would be completed in React. Javascript is used to run the calculations that determine the necessary grade on their final exam. The website contains a drop down menu that allowed a student to select a class and automatically fill the grading policy into the website. This was accomplished by using an API provided by Georgia Tech that sent the grading policies of certain classes. This API is no longer valid, so selecting a class doesn't currently provide any functionality. 

# Running the Website
To run this project, one just needs to clone the repo and open the .html file into any browser.
